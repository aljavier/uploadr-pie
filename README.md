CLI tool to upload files to uploadpie.com
------------------------------------------

Well, I don't even version this script, but I have maken some changes since
I just coded and other friends have helped to improve it. I don't have the idea to talk 
to much here, so I will put a gif at least.

This script have some requirements(besides the obvius: bash and so):
+ cURL - In order to upload the files.
+ scrot - In order to take screenshots and upload it.

Here you can watch the mentioned gif:
![uploadr-pie on action](animated.gif "Uploadr-pie on Action")

Oh well, use it, improve it, share it, enjoy it.

God bless you reader :)
