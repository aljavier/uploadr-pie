CLI tool to upload files to uploadpie.com
------------------------------------------

Well, I don't even version this script, but I have made some changes since
I just coded and other friends have helped to improve it. I don't have the idea to talk 
to much here, so I will put a gif at least.

This script have some requirements(besides the obvius: bash and so):
+ **cURL** - In order to upload the files.
+ **scrot** - In order to take screenshots and upload it.

Here you can watch the mentioned gif:

Oh well, use it, improve it, share it, enjoy it.

God bless you reader :)
